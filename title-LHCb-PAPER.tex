% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  Guidelines for the preparation of LHCb documents are given. This is
  a ``living'' document, that should reflect our current practice. It
  is expected that these guidelines are implemented for papers already
  before they go into the first collaboration wide review. Please
  contact the Editorial Board chair if you have suggestions for
  modifications.
  This is the title page for journal publications (PAPER).
  For a CONF note or ANA note, switch to the appropriate template 
  by uncommenting the corresponding line in the file \verb!main.tex!.

%% Author List ----------------------------
%%  You need to get a new author list!
%\input{LHCb_authorlist.tex}
%
%The author list for journal publications is provided by the Membership Committee shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been given.
%%It will be made available on the page
%%\verb!http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~strauman/forMemCo/LHCb-PAPER-XXXX-XXX/! .
%It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number has beens assigned.
%The author list should be included already at first circulation, 
%to allow new members of the collaboration to verify whether they have been included correctly.
%Occasionally a misspelled name is corrected or associated institutions become full members.
%In that case, a new author list will be sent to you.
%In case line numbering doesn't work well after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after the last author to a separate line.
%
%
%The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
%  collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
%  author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
